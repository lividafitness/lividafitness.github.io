						<hr class="margin-bottom-50">

						<p> Hi, my name’s Danielle Panetta and I’m a personal trainer.</p>
						
						<p>I am passionate about health and fitness. I have have played competitive 
						soccer, run a couple of marathons (one in a school uniform!), cycled across 
						France and climbed a few mountains (including an arduous trek up Mont Blanc, France).
						I’m currently training for a triathlon and planning the next adventure. </p>

						<p>For me, fitness is all about being able to do the things I love comfortably.</p>

						<p>I also have an interest in nutrition and am currently studying for my nutrition 
						qualifications as I believe exercise and nutrition go hand in hand.</p>


						<p>I understand that inevitably everyone is responsible for their own health and fitness 
						goals, but as a trainer I provide the education, structure and accountability to 
						help people transform their lives.</p>

						<p>I have previously coached multiple clients to lose over 10kgs, run half marathons 
						reduce blood pressure and cholesterol and build physical strength, even succeeding 
						where other trainers had failed. </p>

						<p>I’m hold both a certificate III & IV in Fitness through FIA FITNATION, including
						certification for Older Adults training.  I’m registered with Fitness Australia, and 
						certified as a boxing instructor with ACE.  I hold curent CPR & First Aid Certificates.
						</p>
